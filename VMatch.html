                            <h4> The Challenge </h4>
                            <p> How might we improve the quality of life of tetraplegics by using Virtual Reality technologies.</p>
                            <h4> SOLUTION</h4>
                            <p>One of the most overlooked needs of tetraplegic community members is the basic human desire for intimacy, finding partners and dating like anyone else. User research informed us that most tetraplegics have a good neck movement which enables them to use computers and get an education and a job. However, there aren't many solutions that enable them enjoy other aspects of life. So, we designed one - using this web based product, users can select a partner of their choice and an experience of their liking (like a beach, a Halloween adventure, Christmas at the park etc). They can hangout with the chosen partner in a virtual environment and have a rich immersive experience via a series of voice commands. </p>
                            <h4> MY ROLE </h4>
                            <p>Primarily User Research and Product Design. I also contributed heavily to UX Design.</p>
                            <h4> PROCESS </h4>
                            <h5> User Research </h5>
                            
                            <p> I interviewed close relatives of tetraplegic patients to get insights about their lives and pain points. These interviews revealed the following key insights - 
                            <ol type="1">
                            <li> Most of the tetraplegic patients have a good neck control and can use computers with head mounted stylus. This enables them to get an education and a job. </li>

                            <li> They do not have a very active social or love life. They have the same human desires and needs with respect to intimacy but due to lack of independence and options it remains an unmet need. </li>

                            <li> They value privacy and independence in their love life just like anyone else. </li>
                            </ol>
                            <br>
                            <h5> Persona and Feature Defintion </h5>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/VMatch_ideas.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" >
                            <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Generating ideas for ways we could help tetraplegic people through Virtual Reality</figcaption><br>
                            <p>I did design thinking style brainstorming session with my team to come up with product ideas that could help enhance the quality of life for Joe and enable him to explore and enjoy life like other teenagers. The idea that got up-voted the most was to build - 
<ol type="1">
<li> A solution to help Joe independently explore his love life.</li>

<li> A solution that is easy for Joe to use.</li>

<li> It should give some level of freedom to Joe.</li>
                            <br>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/VMatch_persona.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" >
                            <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Joe Stiner - One of our personas</figcaption><br> <Br>
                            <h4> Storyboard </h4>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/VMatch_storyboard.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" >
                            <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Generating ideas for ways we could help tetraplegic people through Virtual Reality</figcaption><br>
                            <br>
                            <p>The storyboard above highlights the task flow that Joe would go through to use the app to go on a Halloween experience with his chosen friend using simple voice commands</p>
                            <h4>Future Prospects</h4>
                            <p>We developed a basic prototype for Google Cardboard and feel that additional features can be built on top of this basic framework e.g. taking somebody out on a date and choosing from locations such as a bar, restaurant, the movies etc. The scalability potential for VMatch is unlimited. It can be used not just for tetraplegics but to build communities for any kind of people. It can also be used to bring people geographically spaces apart feel closer to each other. VMatch can also be used by physicians and mental health professionals as tool to prevent social isolation in their patients with some kind of a handicap. </p>
