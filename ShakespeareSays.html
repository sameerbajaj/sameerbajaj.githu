                            <h4> Brief </h4>
                            <p> To develop a web app and chrome extension that converts an inputted URL to a humourous Shakespeare quote that can be shared with others. </p>
                            <h4> Problem Statement </h4>
                            <p>We felt that most of the existing URL shorteners create URLs that are hard to memorize. They were also not intuitive to use and weren't quick enough to generate a URL on the go.  </p>
                            <h4> Solution </h4>
                            <p>We developed a web application and chrome extension based on a local webserver using flask (programmed in Python). We connected a database of of 50 funny Shakespeare quotes and designed the front end in HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. The chrome extension serves the purpose of speeding up the process of generating a custom URL.
                            </p>

                            <h4> Overview and Process </h4>
                            <h5> Google Chrome Extension </h5>
                            <p> The team wanted to create a tool none of us had ever experienced making before. We all agreed that making a Google Chrome extension would be a fun project to do, despite not knowing what it would entail. The function of our extension is simple and fun: after being downloaded to a browser, the user can click on the little Shakespeare icon and find their current browser tab URL embedded within an input field in the pop-up window. By submitting the form the URL is then extended into an Shakespeare quote within the Chrome extension. </p>
                            <br>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/URL_extension.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" >
                            <br>
                            <h5>Front-End</h5>
                            <p>The URL, through a basic HTML “_blank” function, is pulled automatically from the active browser tab, as to make the functionality of translating it into an Elizabethan insult quicker for our users. 
                            While we had no difficulties to obtain the URL of the current tab in the web browser using Javascript, we found it a bit hard to grab the URL in our Chrome extension. We figured this out by going through the Chrome API to find tab specific Javascript methods for the chrome extension.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Back-End</h5>
                            <p>We hand-picked 50 witty and snarky Shakespearean quotes and created our database which is a CSV file.  Every time the user clicks on Shakespeare Says’ Chrome Extension, one of the quotes is appended to the end of the URL. 
                            The Flask server reads in this CSV file on startup and does some basic string processing to deal with encoding issues on the file and remove illegal URL characters to create a list of available insults. When it receives a POST to /create it chooses a random insult.</p>
                            <h4> Final Words </h4>
                            <p> While we had little difficulty creating the web application, we spent a considerable amount of effort in making our Chrome extension functional and easy to use. Because of the limited number of quotes in our database at present, our extension can only generate 50 unique URLs. One way of scaling up is to add more quotes to the CSV file. Another idea we had but did not get down to implementing was adding a serial number at the end of the quote which would increase with every successive click. This would enable the generation of an infinite number of Shakespearean URLs. Implementation of the serial number concept would, however, require us to move away from the csv approach and into a live database approach, so that the current serial number for each insult could be tracked. While it would be possible to track the numbers in memory and store them in a csv, this would cost a lot in terms of I/O.
